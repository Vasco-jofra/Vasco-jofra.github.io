Today we will see how I used `frida` to memoize the computation of a recursive function to optimize the binary and get the flag.

## The binary
We are given a C++ binary. Just **running the binary gives you the flag**, but it will "never" end. Our goal is to **optimize it**.
By looking at the backtrace in gdb we can see that function `sub_13b0` is being called recursively.

After reversing it the minimal amount, I figured out that the function prototype is `void sub_13b0(res_struct *a1, int a2, int64_t a3, int64_t a4)`, where `res_struct` is:
```c
struct res_struct {
  int64_t a;
  int64_t b;
  int64_t c;
};
```

We can also see that if `a2 == 1` or `a2 == 2` the recursion stops (base cases).

## Solution
My idea was to [memoize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) the results of the recursive function and replace `a1` with the cached result when a call with the same input (the combination of `a2`, `a3` and `a4`) occurs.

I didn't want to reverse the function completely and implement it in python and so I decided to use [frida](https://frida.re/) to dynamically hook the function and do the memoization.

My first idea was to **replace the function body** by doing the following:
 - **new input**: call the original function and cache the result
 - **cached input**: write the cached result in `a1` and return immediately

Just as a POC this was the code I started with:
```js
// frida --no-pause --runtime=v8 -l frida_trace.js ./f-hash

var f_hash_addr = 0x555555554000;
var recursive_func_ptr = ptr(f_hash_addr + 0x13b0);
var recursive_func = new NativeFunction(recursive_func_ptr,
                                        'void',
                                        ['pointer', 'int64', 'int64', 'int64']);

Interceptor.replace(recursive_func_ptr, new NativeCallback(function (a1, a2, a3, a4) {
    console.log(" the_recursive_function(a1: " + a1 + ", a2: " + a2 +
                ", a3: " + a3 + ", a4: " + a4 + ")");

    // Call the original function
    recursive_func(a1, a2, a3, a4)

}, 'void', ['pointer', 'int64', 'int64', 'int64']));
```

The problem was that **when I call the original function, its recursive calls won't be hooked**, and so it will just run forever as before. I didn't come up with any way to do this by replacing the body.

---
My next idea was to use `OnEnter`, `OnLeave` and some hackery to get the job done:
 - In the `OnEnter` hook:
   - **new input**: do nothing
   - **cached input**: make `a2 = 1` so that we hit a recursion base case (avoiding further recursion)
 - In the `OnLeave` hook:
   - **new input**: memoize the result
   - **cached input**: replace the `a1` struct with the cached result (because we changed `a2` in the `onEnter` hook and so the result is wrong)

It was a bit of hacky solution but it works. The script:
```js
// frida --no-pause --runtime=v8 -l frida_trace.js ./f-hash

// ====================
// UTILS
// ====================
function deref64(i) {
    return Memory.readU64(ptr(i))
}

function p(s) {
  console.log(s);
}

// ====================
// Hooks
// ====================
// Intercepts the recursive function
var mem = new Object();

function hash_args(args) {
    return args[1] + "_" + args[2] + "_" + args[3];
};

var f_hash_addr = 0x555555554000;
var recursive_func_ptr = ptr(f_hash_addr + 0x13b0);

Interceptor.attach(recursive_func_ptr, {
  onEnter: function(args) {
    this.a1 = parseInt(args[0]);
    this.hash = hash_args(args);

    if (typeof mem[this.hash] !== 'undefined') {
        // Recursion stoppage case (we will replace the result in the OnLeave hook)
        args[1] = ptr(1);
    }
  },

  onLeave: function(retval) {
    if (typeof mem[this.hash] === 'undefined') {
        // We have never seen this.. Memoize!
        mem[this.hash] = [deref64(this.a1), deref64(this.a1+8), deref64(this.a1+16)];
    } else {
        // Replace the fake res with the memoized one
        var prev_results = mem[this.hash]
        ptr(this.a1).writeU64(prev_results[0])
        ptr(this.a1+8).writeU64(prev_results[1])
        ptr(this.a1+16).writeU64(prev_results[2])
    }
  }
});
```
