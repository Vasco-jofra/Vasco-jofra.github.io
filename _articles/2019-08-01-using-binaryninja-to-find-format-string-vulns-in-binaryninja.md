In this article I describe a plugin I developed to find format string vulnerabilities using binary ninja.
It was published on *Paged Out!*'s issue #1, winning **Best Security/RE article** and presented in SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil at *Hackers to Hackers Conference 2019*

You can find the article here: [https://pagedout.institute/?page=issues.php](https://pagedout.institute/?page=issues.php) (issue #1).

You can find the plugin here: [https://github.com/Vasco-jofra/format-string-finder-binja](https://github.com/Vasco-jofra/format-string-finder-binja) (or install it via the plugin manager in binary ninja).
