RUN: bundle exec jekyll serve

NOTES: 
 - Use `<p class="figure-caption">XXX</p>` to add figure or text snippet captions

TODO:
 - center images
 - fix font stuff which still looks ugly I think
 - articles:
   - kernel exploitation - figure out the ebfp stuff and do a writeup on it
   - kernel exploitation - PTE stuff
   + fmt string plugin - paged out (and the csgo fmt string that was found)
   + my list of curiosities

MAYBE:
 - remove seo stuff?
 - comments?
 - check firefox different behavior on link active
 - make the logo have better resolution. It's too pixelated
