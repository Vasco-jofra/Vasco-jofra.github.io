TODO:
 - articles:
   - kernel exploitation - figure out the ebfp stuff and do a writeup on it
   - kernel exploitation - PTE stuff
   + fmt string plugin - paged out (and the csgo fmt string that was found)
   - my list of curiosities

DONE:
 - articles:
   - CodeQL query finding kernel structures with function pointers
 - tools:
   - fmt string plugin
   - prop
 - make articles the main page?
 - archive include articles as well
 - tags
 - pretify the archive (aka dates in monospace)
 - fix home post link only working on title and part of the excerpt
 - author links
 - wall of tags
 - fix tags on mobile
 - check RSS: too much text
 - highlight the currently selected header link

MAYBE:
 - remove seo stuff?
 - next post at the end of a post?
 - comments?
 - check firefox different behavior on link active
 - make the logo have better resolution. It's too pixelated
